            <h3><center>My name is Didrik Strand Marthinsen and I'm born in 1998 and currently living at Tj√∏me, Norway. I currently work full-time at a local store and practicing webdevelopment on the side. I have a wife and a son, and a lot of my spare-time goes is spent on them. I quit my last study (journalism) for the chance to have a family life, which I have no regrets about doing.</center></h4>

            <h3><center>I am both a sports- and filmenthusiast. I collect films as well as i root for my favorite teams in the NFL, NBA and the Premier League. I don't only find it fun to watch sports, It's also fun to play a few of them, isn't it? I have been traveling quite a bit in the start of my adult life, and my favorite food is pizza.</center></h4>
